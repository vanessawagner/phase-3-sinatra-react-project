# Phase 3 Project Frontend (React Based App)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a full-stack application that interacts with APIs from my Sinatra backend to perform multiple CRUD actions. Please refer to the Backend which is available here: https://github.com/vanessawagner/phase-3-sinatra-react-project

The frontend uses state to update according to POST, DELETE, and PATCH requests. 

This app uses good OO design patterns with separate classes for each of the models, and creates instance and class methods as necessary.

The routes in the frontend and backend of the application (both client side and back end) follow RESTful convention.
